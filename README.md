# ducktales-ecosystem

This is a smart contract to be deployed and used with [the ducktales React front end](https://github.com/dylanavery720/ducktales).

I use `testrpc` and then `truffle console`, `truffle compile`, and `truffle migrate`. 

Contract abi and address are hardcoded for now in the front end so make sure to change them accordingly.
